This project presents a cryptocurrency trading strategy that identifies and exploits cointegrated pairs of cryptocurrencies. The core concept is to find pairs of cryptocurrencies whose prices move together in a predictable manner over time. By going short on one and long on the other, the strategy aims to profit from the relative price movements between the pairs, regardless of the overall market trend. This method leverages statistical arbitrage and seeks to capture discrepancies in the cointegrated relationship, thereby optimizing trading decisions and enhancing returns.
